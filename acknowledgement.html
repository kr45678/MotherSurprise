  <h2>Thank You, Mom</h2>
  <p>
    Words can never truly express the depth of my gratitude for all that you have done. You are my guiding light, my rock, and my endless source of love and strength. 
    <br><br>
    This project is just a small way of saying how much you mean to me. I love you, Mom.
